<h2><span>ABOUT ME</span></h2>
<p>
I am a 30 year old student from Stockholm, Sweden. My interests in web-development started in my early years. At that time I was focused on HTML and CSS.
</p>
<div class="mini-spacer"></div>
<p>
 Now I am also learning JavaScript which I am looking forward to work with in the future.
